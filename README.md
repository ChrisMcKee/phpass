PHPass: Portable PHP password hashing framework
-----------------------------------------------

This library is a reimplementation of the [PHPass](http://openwall.com/phpass/) class. It is 100% compatible with the original, the class is simply updated to use more PHP5 conventions.

In keeping with the original project, this library is entered into the public domain.
